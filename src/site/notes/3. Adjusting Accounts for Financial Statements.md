## Timing and Period 


### The Accounting Period 

- Time Period Assumption - The time period assumption presumes that an organization’s activities can be divided into specific time periods such as a month, a three-month quarter, a six month interval, or a year.
![zz - 3. Adjusting Accounts for Financial Statements.png](/img/user/zz%20-%203.%20Adjusting%20Accounts%20for%20Financial%20Statements.png)


The annual reporting period is not always a calendar year ending on December 31. An ==organization can use a fiscal year consisting of any 12 consecutive months== or 52 weeks. For example, Gap’s fiscal year consistently ends the final week of January or the first week of February each year.


> [!info]
> Companies with little seasonal variation in sales often use the calendar year as their fiscal year. **Facebook** uses calendar-year reporting. Companies that have seasonal variations in sales often use a **natural business year** end, which is when sales are at their lowest level for the year. The natural business year for retailers such as **Target** and **Dick’s Sporting Goods** ends around January 31, after the holidays.



### Accrual Basis Vs Cash Basis 

- **Accrual basis** accounting records revenues when services and products are delivered and records expenses when incurred (matched with revenues).  
- **Cash basis** accounting records revenues when cash is received and records expenses when cash is paid. Cash basis income is cash receipts minus cash payments.


> [!info] 
> Most agree that accrual accounting better reflects business performance than cash basis accounting. Accrual accounting also increases the comparability of financial statements from period to period.

### Recognizing Revenues and Expenses


- **Revenue recognition principle** requires that revenue be recorded when goods or services are provided to customers and at an amount expected to be received from customers. Adjustments ensure revenue is recognized (reported) in the time period when those services and products are provided.  
- **Expense recognition** (or matching) principle requires that expenses be recorded in the same accounting period as the revenues that are recognized as a result of those expenses.



> [!attention] Ethical Risk
> **Clawbacks from Accounting Fraud** Former executives at Saba Software, a cloud-based talent management system, were charged with accounting fraud by the SEC for falsifying revenue to boost income. This alleged overstatement of income led to a payback of millions of dollars to the company by the former CEO and former CFO. See SEC release 2015–28. ■


**Framework for Adjustments** : Four types of adjustments exist for transactions and events that extend over more than one period.

1. Deferral of expense
2. Deferral of revenue
3. Accrued expense
4. Accrued revenue

Adjustments are made using a 3-step process, as shown in Exhibit 3.4.


![zz - 3. Adjusting Accounts for Financial Statements-1.png](/img/user/zz%20-%203.%20Adjusting%20Accounts%20for%20Financial%20Statements-1.png)


Each **adjusting entry** made at the end of an accounting period ==reflects a transaction or event that is not yet recorded.==An adjusting entry affects one or more income statement accounts and one or more balance sheet accounts (but **never** the Cash account).
## Deferral of Expense 

**Prepaid expenses, or deferred expenses**, are assets paid for in advance of receiving their benefits. When these assets are used, those advance payments become expenses.

> [!abstract] Framework
> Adjusting entries for prepaid expenses increase expenses and decrease assets, as shown in the T-accounts of Exhibit 3.5. This adjustment shows the using up of prepaid expenses. To demonstrate accounting for prepaid expenses, we look at prepaid insurance, supplies, and depreciation. In each case we decrease an asset (balance sheet) account and increase an expense (income statement) account.

### Prepaid Insurance 

Prepaid insurance expires with time. We use our three-step process.
1. We determine that the current balance of FastForward’s prepaid insurance is equal to its $2,400 payment for 24 months of insurance benefits that began on December 1, 2019.
2. As time passes, the benefits of the insurance gradually expire and a portion of the Prepaid Insurance asset becomes expense. For instance, one month’s insurance coverage expires by December 31, 2019. This expense is $100, or 1/24 of $2,400, which leaves $2,300.
3. The adjusting entry to record this expense and reduce the asset, along with T-account postings, follows.

### Supplies 

We count supplies at period-end and make an adjusting entry.

- Step 1: FastForward purchased $9,720 of supplies in December, some of which were used during that same month. When financial statements are prepared at December 31, the cost of supplies used during December is expensed. 
- Step 2: When FastForward computes (physically counts) its remaining unused supplies at December 31, it finds $8,670 of supplies remaining of the $9,720 total supplies. The $1,050 difference between these two amounts is December’s supplies expense.  
- Step 3: The adjusting entry to record this expense and reduce the Supplies asset account, along with T-account postings, follows.

> [!info] Explanation
> 
> The balance of the Supplies account is $8,670 after posting—equaling the cost of the remaining supplies. Not making the adjustment on or before December 31 would  
> 
> - Understate expenses by $1,050 for the December income statement.
> - Overstate supplies by $1,050 in the December 31 balance sheet.

### Other Prepaid Expenses

Other prepaid expenses, such as Prepaid Rent and Prepaid Advertising, are accounted for exactly as insurance and supplies are.

Some prepaid expenses are both paid for and fully used up within a single period. One example is when a company pays monthly rent on the first day of each month. In this case, we record the cash paid with a debit to Rent Expense instead of an asset account.


### Depreciation 

A special category of prepaid expenses is plant assets, which are long-term tangible assets used to produce and sell products and services. Plant assets provide benefits for more than one period.

**Depreciation** is the allocation of the costs of these assets over their expected useful lives. Depreciation expense is recorded with an adjusting entry similar to that for other prepaid expenses. 

- Step 1: FastForward purchased equipment for $26,000 in early December to use in earning revenue. This equipment’s cost must be depreciated.  
- Step 2: The equipment is expected to have a useful life (benefit period) of five years and to be worth about $8,000 at the end of five years. This means the net cost of this equipment over its useful life is $18,000 ($26,000 − $8,000). FastForward depreciates it using straight-line **depreciation**, which allocates equal amounts of the asset’s net cost to depreciation during its useful life. Dividing the $18,000 net cost by the 60 months (5 years) in the asset’s useful life gives a monthly cost of $300 ($18,000∕60).  
- Step 3: The adjusting entry to record monthly depreciation expense, along with T-account postings, follows.
![zz - 3. Adjusting Accounts for Financial Statements-7.png](/img/user/zz%20-%203.%20Adjusting%20Accounts%20for%20Financial%20Statements-7.png)


> [!info] Explanation
> After posting the adjustment, the Equipment account ($26,000) minus its Accumulated Depreciation ($300) account equals the $25,700 net cost. The $300 balance in the Depreciation Expense account is reported in the December income statement. Not making the adjustment at December 31 would
> - Understate expenses by $300 for the December income statement. 
> - Overstate assets by $300 in the December 31 balance sheet.
> ![zz - 3. Adjusting Accounts for Financial Statements-8.png](/img/user/zz%20-%203.%20Adjusting%20Accounts%20for%20Financial%20Statements-8.png)



**Accumulated Depreciation** is a separate contra account. A contra account is an account linked with another account, it has an opposite normal balance, and it is reported as a subtraction from that other account’s balance. FastForward’s contra account of Accumulated Depreciation Equipment is subtracted from the Equipment account in the balance sheet.

## Deferral of Revenue 

**Unearned revenue** is cash received in advance of providing products and services. Unearned revenues, or deferred revenues, are liabilities. When cash is accepted, an obligation to provide products or services is accepted.


> [!info] Framework
> As products or services are provided, the liability decreases, and the unearned revenues become earned revenues. Adjusting entries for unearned revenue decrease the unearned revenue (balance sheet) account and increase the revenue (income statement) account, as shown in Exhibit 3.8.
> ![zz - 3. Adjusting Accounts for Financial Statements-9.png](/img/user/zz%20-%203.%20Adjusting%20Accounts%20for%20Financial%20Statements-9.png)


Unearned revenues are common in sporting and concert events. When the **Boston Celtics** receive cash from advance ticket sales, they record it in an unearned revenue account called Deferred Game Revenues. The Celtics record revenue as games are played.

### Unearned Consulting Revenue 

FastForward has unearned revenues. The company agreed on December 26 to provide consulting services to a client for 60 days for a fixed fee of $3,000. 
- Step 1: On December 26, the client paid the 60-day fee in advance, covering the period December 27 to February 24. The entry to record the cash received in advance is

![zz - 3. Adjusting Accounts for Financial Statements-10.png](/img/user/zz%20-%203.%20Adjusting%20Accounts%20for%20Financial%20Statements-10.png)This advance payment increases cash and creates a liability to do consulting work over the next 60 days (5 days this year and 55 days next year). 
- Step 2: As time passes, FastForward earns this payment through consulting. By December 31, it has provided five days’ service and earned 5∕60 of the $3,000 unearned revenue. This amounts to $250 ($3,000 × 5∕60). The revenue recognition principle requires that $250 of unearned revenue be reported as revenue on the December income statement.  
- Step 3: The adjusting entry to reduce the liability account and recognize earned revenue, along with T-account postings, follows.

![zz - 3. Adjusting Accounts for Financial Statements-11.png](/img/user/zz%20-%203.%20Adjusting%20Accounts%20for%20Financial%20Statements-11.png)



> [!tip] Explanation
> The adjusting entry transfers $250 from unearned revenue (a liability account) to a revenue account. Not making the adjustment  Understates revenue by $250 in the December income statement. Overstates unearned revenue by $250 on the December 31 balance sheet.  The following highlights the adjustment for unearned revenue.

## Accrued Expense 

Accrued expenses are costs that are incurred in a period that are both unpaid and unrecorded. Accrued expenses are reported on the income statement for the period when incurred.


- Step 1: Its employee is paid every two weeks on Friday. On December 12 and 26, the wages are paid, recorded in the journal, and posted to the ledger.  
- Step 2: The calendar in Exhibit 3.10 shows three working days after the December 26 payday (29, 30, and 31). This means the employee has earned three days’ salary by the close of business on Wednesday, December 31, yet this salary cost has not been paid or recorded. FastForward must report the added expense and liability for unpaid salary from December 29, 30, and 31.
![zz - 3. Adjusting Accounts for Financial Statements-13.png](/img/user/zz%20-%203.%20Adjusting%20Accounts%20for%20Financial%20Statements-13.png)

Step 3: The adjusting entry for accrued salaries, along with T-account postings, follows.

## Accrued Interest Expense

Companies accrue interest expense on notes payable (loans) and other long-term liabilities at the end of a period. Interest expense is incurred as time passes. Unless interest is paid on the last day of an accounting period, we need to adjust for interest expense incurred but not yet paid. This means we must accrue interest cost from the most recent payment date up to the end of the period. The formula for computing accrued interest is

Principal amount owed × Annual interest rate × Fraction of year since last payment

If a company has a $6,000 loan from a bank at 5% annual interest, then 30 days’ accrued interest expense is $25—computed as $6,000 × 0.05 × 30∕360. The adjusting entry debits Interest Expense for $25 and credits Interest Payable for $25.

### Future Cash Payment of Accrued Expenses

Accrued expenses at the end of one accounting period result in cash payment in a future period(s). Recall that FastForward recorded accrued salaries of $210. On January 9, the first payday of the next period, the following entry settles the accrued liability (salaries payable) and records salaries expense for seven days of work in January.

![zz - 3. Adjusting Accounts for Financial Statements-16.png](/img/user/zz%20-%203.%20Adjusting%20Accounts%20for%20Financial%20Statements-16.png)


The $210 debit is the payment of the liability for the three days’ salary accrued on December 31. The $490 debit records the salary for January’s first seven working days (including the New Year’s Day holiday) as an expense of the new accounting period. The $700 credit records the total amount of cash paid to the employee.


## Accrued Revenue 

**Accrued revenues** are revenues earned in a period that are both unrecorded and not yet received in cash (or other assets). 

An example is a technician who bills customers after the job is done. If one-third of a job is complete by the end of a period, then the technician must record one-third of the expected billing as revenue in that period—even though there is no billing or collection.

> [!info] Framework
> The adjusting entries for accrued revenues increase a revenue (income statement) account and increase an asset (balance sheet) account, as shown in Exhibit 3.11. Accrued revenues usually come from services, products, interest, and rent. We use service fees and interest to show how to adjust for accrued revenues.

### Accrued Services Revenue

Accrued revenues are recorded when adjusting entries are made at the end of the accounting period. These accrued revenues are earned but unrecorded because either the buyer has not yet paid or the seller has not yet billed the buyer. FastForward provides an example.  
- Step 1: In the second week of December, FastForward agreed to provide 30 days of consulting services to a fitness club for a fixed fee of $2,700 (or $90 per day). FastForward will provide services from December 12 through January 10, or 30 days of service. The club agrees to pay FastForward $2,700 on January 10 when the service is complete. 
- Step 2: At December 31, 20 days of services have already been provided. Because the contracted services have not yet been entirely provided, FastForward has neither billed the club nor recorded the services already provided. Still, FastForward has earned two-thirds of the 30-day fee, or $1,800 ($2,700 × 20∕30). The revenue recognition principle requires FastForward to report the $1,800 on the December income statement. The balance sheet reports that the club owes FastForward $1,800. 
- Step 3: The adjusting entry for accrued services, along with T-account postings, follows.

## Preparing Financial Statements

![zz - 3. Adjusting Accounts for Financial Statements-22.png](/img/user/zz%20-%203.%20Adjusting%20Accounts%20for%20Financial%20Statements-22.png)

We prepare financial statements in the following order: (1) income statement, (2) statement of owner’s equity, and (3) balance sheet. This order makes sense because the balance sheet uses information from the statement of owner’s equity, which in turn uses information from the income statement. The statement of cash flows is usually the final statement prepared.

## Decision Analysis - Profit Margin 

A useful measure of a company’s operating results is the ratio of its net income to net sales. This ratio is called profit margin, or return on sales, and is computed as

$$ \text{Profit Margin} = \frac{\text{Net income}}{\text{Net Sales}}$$
