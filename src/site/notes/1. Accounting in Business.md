## Importance of Accounting


**Accounting** is an information and measurement system that **identifies**, **records**, and **communicates an organization’s business activities**.

Technology plays a major role in accounting. Technology reduces the time, effort, and cost of recordkeeping while improving accuracy.


### Users of Accounting Information

Accounting is called the *language of business* as it helps users make informed decisions. Users are classified into:

#### 1. External Users  
They do *not directly manage* the organization and rely on *general-purpose financial statements*.

- Lenders – Assess creditworthiness for loans.  
- Shareholders (Investors) – Decide on buying/selling shares.  
- Board of Directors – Evaluate executive performance.  
- External Auditors – Verify compliance with accounting standards.  
- Employees & Labor Unions – Negotiate for better wages.  
- Regulators – Ensure legal compliance (e.g., IRS for taxes).  
- Voters & Government Officials – Assess government and agency performance.  
- Contributors to Nonprofits – Evaluate donation use and impact.  
- Suppliers – Assess customer creditworthiness.  
- Customers – Evaluate supplier stability.

#### 2. Internal Users  
They *directly manage* the organization and use *specialized internal reports*.

- Purchasing Managers – Plan and control purchases.  
- HR Managers – Monitor payroll, benefits, performance.  
- Production Managers – Ensure quality and efficiency.  
- Distribution Managers – Manage product/service delivery.  
- Marketing Managers – Analyze markets and set prices.  
- Service Managers – Improve customer service.  
- R&D Managers – Evaluate innovation costs and revenues.




## Fundamental of Accounting 

### Ethics - A Key Concept
Ethics are beliefs that separate right from wrong. They are accepted standards of good and bad behavior. Accountants face ethical choices as they prepare financial reports.

#### Fraud Triangle: Ethics Under Attack
The fraud triangle shows that three factors push a person to commit fraud:
1. **Opportunity** – A person must be able to commit fraud with a low risk of getting caught.
2. **Pressure, or incentive** – A person must feel pressure or have incentive to commit fraud.
3. **Rationalization, or attitude** – A person justifies fraud or does not see its criminal nature.

> **Enforcing Ethics**  
> In response to major accounting scandals, like those at Enron and WorldCom, Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), to help stop financial abuses. SOX requires documentation and verification of internal controls and emphasizes effective internal controls.




### Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)
Financial accounting is governed by concepts and rules known as generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). GAAP wants information to have relevance and faithful representation.


> [!info]
> The **Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)** is given the task of setting GAAP from the **Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)**. The SEC is a U.S. government agency that oversees proper use of GAAP by companies that sell stock and debt to the public.




- **Objectives**—to provide information useful to investors, creditors, and others.
- **Qualitative characteristics**—to require information that has relevance and faithful representation.  
- **Elements**—to define items in financial statements. 
- **Recognition and measurement**—to set criteria for an item to be recognized as an element; and how to measure it.



**International Standard** :- Our global economy demands comparability in accounting reports. The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issues International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) that identify preferred accounting practices. These standards are similar to, but sometimes different from, U.S. GAAP. The FASB and IASB are working to reduce differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS.


### Principle, Assumptions, and Constraints 

There are two types of accounting principles (and assumptions).
1. General principles are the assumptions, concepts, and guidelines for preparing financial statements
2. Specific principles are detailed rules used in reporting business transactions and events


- **Accounting Principles** - There are four general principles.
	1. **Measurement Principle (cost principle)** - Accounting information is based on actual cost. Cost is measured on a cash or equal-to-cash basis. This means if cash is given for a service, its cost is measured by the cash paid. If something besides cash is exchanged (such as a car traded for a truck), cost is measured as the cash value of what is given up or received. Information based on cost is considered objective. Objectivity means that information is supported by independent, unbiased evidence. Later chapters cover adjustments to market and introduce fair value.
	2. **Revenue Recognition Principle** - Revenue is recognized (1) when goods or services are provided to customers and (2) at the amount expected to be received from the customer. Revenue (sales) is the amount received from selling products and services. The amount received is usually in cash, but it also can be a customer’s promise to pay at a future date, called credit sales. (To recognize means to record it.)
	3. **Expense recognition principle (matching principle)** - A company records the expenses it incurred to generate the revenue reported. An example is rent costs of office space.
	4. **Full disclosure principle** - A company reports the details behind financial statements that would impact users’ decisions. Those disclosures are often in footnotes to the statements.
- **Accounting Assumptions** - There are four accounting assumptions.
	1. **Going-Concern Assumption** - Accounting information presumes that the business will continue operating instead of being closed or sold. This means, for example, that property is reported at cost instead of liquidation value.
	2. **Monetary unit assumption** - Transactions and events are expressed in monetary, or money, units. Examples of monetary units are the U.S. dollar and the Mexican peso.
	3. **Time period assumption** - The life of a company can be divided into time periods, such as months and years, and useful reports can be prepared for those periods.
	4. **Business entity assumption** - A business is accounted for separately from other business entities and its owner. The  table below  describes four common business entities.

> [!info] Accounting Constraint
> The cost-benefit constraint, or cost constraint, says that information disclosed by an entity must have benefits to the user that are greater than the costs of providing it. Materiality, or the ability of information to influence decisions, is also sometimes mentioned as a constraint. Conservatism and industry practices are sometimes listed as well.
