## Basis of Financial Statement

The Process to go from transaction and events to financial statements includes :
1. Identify each transaction and event from source documents. 
2. Analyze each transaction and event using the accounting equation. 
3. Record relevant transactions and events in a journal. 
4. Post journal information to ledger accounts. Prepare and analyze the trial balance and financial statements.

> [!info] Source documents 
> identify and describe transactions and events entering the accounting system. They can be in hard copy or electronic form. Examples are sales receipts, checks, purchase orders, bills from suppliers, payroll records, and bank statements.


- Asset Accounts - Assets are resources owned or controlled by a company. Resources have expected future benefits. Most accounting systems include (at a minimum) separate accounts for the assets described here.
	- **Cash** 
	- **Accounts Receivable** 
		- Accounts receivable are increased by credit sales or sales on account (or on credit). They are decreased by customer payments. We record all increases and decreases in receivables in the Accounts Receivable account. When there are multiple customers, separate records are kept for each, titled Accounts Receivable—‘Customer Name’.
	- **Note Receivable**
		- A note receivable, or promissory note, is a written promise of another entity to pay a specific sum of money on a specified future date to the holder of the note; the **holder has an asset recorded in a Note (or Notes) Receivable account.**
	- **Prepaid Accounts**
		- Prepaid accounts (or prepaid expenses) are assets from prepayments of future expenses (expenses expected to be incurred in future accounting periods). When the expenses are later incurred, the amounts in prepaid accounts are transferred to expense accounts.
		- When financial statements are prepared, (1) all expired and used prepaid accounts are recorded as expenses and (2) all unexpired and unused prepaid accounts are recorded as assets (reflecting future benefits).
	- **Supplies Accounts**
		- Supplies are assets until they are used. When they are used up, their costs are reported as expenses. Unused supplies are recorded in a Supplies asset account.
	- **Equipment Accounts**
		- Equipment is an asset. When equipment is used and wears down, its cost is gradually reported as an expense (called depreciation).
	- **Building Accounts**
		- Buildings such as stores, offices, warehouses, and factories are assets because they provide expected future benefits. When a building is used and wears down, its cost is reported as an expense (called depreciation).
	- **Land**
		- The cost of land is recorded in a Land account. The cost of buildings located on the land is separately recorded in building accounts.

- **Liability Accounts** - Liabilities are obligations to transfer assets or provide products or services to others. They are claims (by creditors) against assets.
	- **Accounts Payable**
		- Accounts payable are promises to pay later. Payables can come from purchases of merchandise-for-resale, supplies, equipment, and services. We record all increases and decreases in payables in the Accounts Payable account.
	- **Note Payable**
		- A note payable is a written promissory note to pay a future amount. It is recorded as either a short-term note payable or a long-term note payable, depending on when it must be repaid.
	- **Unearned Revenue Accounts**
		- Unearned revenue is a liability that is settled in the future when a company delivers its products or services. When customers pay in advance for products or services (before revenue is earned), the seller records this receipt as unearned revenue. Examples of unearned revenue include magazine subscriptions collected in advance by a publisher, rent collected in advance by a landlord, and season ticket sales by sports teams.
	- **Accrued Liabilities**
		- Accrued liabilities are amounts owed that are not yet paid. Examples are wages payable, taxes payable, and interest payable. These often are recorded in separate liability accounts by the same title.
- **Equity Accounts** - The owner’s claim on a company’s assets is called equity or owner’s equity. Equity is the owner’s residual interest in the assets of a business after subtracting liabilities. Equity is impacted by four types of accounts.
	- **Owner Capital**
		- When an owner invests in a company, it increases both assets and equity. The increase to equity is recorded in the account titled Owner, Capital (where the owner’s name is inserted in place of “Owner”).
	- **Owner Withdrawals**
		- When an owner withdraws assets for personal use, it decreases both company assets and total equity. The decrease to equity is recorded in an account titled Owner, Withdrawals.
	- **Revenue Accounts**
		- Amounts received from sales of products and services to customers are recorded in revenue accounts, which increase equity.
	- **Expense Accounts**
		- Amounts used for costs of providing products and services are recorded in expense accounts, which decrease equity. Examples of expense accounts are Advertising Expense, Salaries Expense, Rent Expense, Utilities Expense, and Insurance Expense. Expenses always decrease equity.



- The collection of all accounts and their balances is called a ledger (or general ledger). A company’s size and diversity of operations affect the number of accounts needed.
- A small company can have as few as 20 accounts; a large company can require thousands. The chart of accounts is a list of all ledger accounts and has an identification number assigned to each account. 



## Double Entry Accounting

### Debit and Credit 

- Debits and Credits  A T-account represents a ledger account and is used to show the effects of transactions. Its name comes from its shape like the letter T.


- The left side of an account is called the debit side, or Dr. The right side is called the credit side, or Cr.


- The difference between total debits and total credits for an account, including any beginning balance, is the account balance. 
	- When total debits exceed total credits, the account has a debit balance. 
	- It has a credit balance when total credits exceed total debits. 
	- When total debits equal total credits, the account has a zero balance.


### Double-Entry System

Double-entry accounting demands the accounting equation remain in balance, which means that for each transaction: 
- At least two accounts are involved, with at least one debit and one credit. 
- Total amount debited must equal total amount credited.  

This means total debits must equal total credits for all entries, and total debit account balances in the ledger must equal total credit account balances. 

The system for recording debits and credits follows the accounting equation—see Exhibit 2.6.

## Analyzing and Processing Transactions

A journal is a complete record of each transaction in one place. It also shows debits and credits for each transaction.

Recording transaction in a journal called journalizing.

![zz - Wild and Shaw - 2018 - Fundamental Accounting Principles-2.png](/img/user/zz%20-%20Wild%20and%20Shaw%20-%202018%20-%20Fundamental%20Accounting%20Principles-2.png)

Journalizing transactions requires an understanding of a journal. While companies can use various journals, every company uses a general journal. It can be used to record any transaction.

1. Date the transaction
2. Enter titles of accounts debited and then enter amounts in the debit column on the same line.
3. Enter titles of accounts credited and then enter amounts in the Credit Column on the Same line.
4. Enter a brief explanation of the transaction on the line below the entry (it often references source documents)


> [!hint] Posting Reference (PR Column)
> A blank line is left between each journal entry for clarity. When a transaction is first recorded, the posting reference (PR) column is left blank (in a manual system). Later, when posting entries to the ledger, the identification numbers of the individual ledger accounts are entered in the PR column.

## Trail Balance 

A trial balance is a list of all ledger accounts and their balances at a point in time.

> [!info] Preparing a Trial Balance
> 1. List each account title and its amount (from the ledger) in the trial balance. If an account has a zero balance, list it with a zero in its normal balance column (or omit it). 
> 2. Compute the total of debit balances and the total of credit balances. 
> 3. Verify (prove) total debit balances equal total credit balances.

## Decision Analysis - Debt Ratio 



- A company that finances a relatively large portion of its assets with liabilities is said to have higher financial leverage. 
- Higher financial leverage means greater risk because liabilities must be repaid and often require regular interest payments (equity financing does not). One measure of the risk associated with liabilities is the **debt ratio**.
$$ \text{Debt Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Liablities}}{\text{Total Assetss}}$$
